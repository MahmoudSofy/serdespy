!! MODEL DESCRIPTION: Tyco Electronics System 4-port S-parameter 
!! MODEL STATUS: Developmental

!! MODEL FREQUENCY RANGE: DC to 60 GHz in 10 MHz frequency steps
!! MODEL EDGE RATE LIMITATION: 8.3 ps (Using conservative 0.5/Fmax rule of thumb)
!! 
!! TIME-DOMAIN TRANSFORM CAUTIONS: 
!! 1.) Do not simulate transient edge rates faster than the number listed above.  Edge rates faster than this number 
!!     contain significant spectral content at frequencies above the model's highest frequency. 
!! 2.) Even when simulating edge rates that are slower than the number listed above, be aware that the best time 
!!     resolution possible with a direct iFFT is (1 / 2Fmax).  As a result, time resolution is typically not adequate 
!!     for most time-domain simulations unless tricks such as windowing are used to minimize leakage and aliasing. 
!! 3.) Because the model has a uniform frequency step, a direct iFFT will result in an impulse that that has a time 
!!     length given by either (1 / Fstep) or (1 / 2Fstep), depending on the transform being used.  Care has been taken 
!!     in selecting the frequency step to ensure a settled impulse response for the model.  Therefore, convolution with 
!!     the model's impulse response should present no issues.  However, if directly concatenating s-parameter models 
!!     in the frequency domain a user must either interpolate necessary interim frequencies or complete impulse response 
!!     zero-padding.  Impulse response zero-padding is more difficult, but more accurate.
